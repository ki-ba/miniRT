## Description

This project is a simple ray-tracing engine written in C. It is designed to render basic shapes such as spheres, planes, and cylinders, and to apply basic lighting and shading techniques. 
The project is structured to allow for easy expansion and modification, making it a great starting point for learning about ray tracing and computer graphics.

## Instructions

To compile the project, navigate to the project directory and run `make`.
This will create an executable named `miniRT`. To run the program, use `./miniRT <scene_file.rt>`, where `<scene_file.rt>` is a text file that describes the scene to be rendered.


## Features

- Basic rendering of spheres, planes, and cylinders
- Multiple colored point light sources
- Specular reflection
- Downscaled rendering to navigate using WASD / ZC and mouse
